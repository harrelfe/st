title: Longitudinal Ordinal Models as a General Framework for Medical Outcomes
description: "Univariate ordinal models can be used to model a wide variety of longitudinal outcomes, using only standard software, through the use of Markov processes.  This talk will show how longitudinal ordinal models unify a wide variety of types of analyses including time to event, recurrent events, continuous responses interrupted by events, and multiple events that are capable of being placed in a hierarchy.  Through the use of marginalization over the previous state in an ordinal multi-state transition model, one may obtain virtually any estimand of interest.  Both frequentist and Bayesian methods can be used to fit the model and draw inferences."
